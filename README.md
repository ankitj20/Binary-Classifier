# Binary-Classifier
In this project, I trained classification models on MNIST dataset to tell whether a random digit in the dataset is the digit given by user. 

This program will ask user for a digit from 0 to 9, and after that it will tell whether a random digit from dataset is the same digit given by user. This program uses RandomForestClassifier which gave a precision of 99%.
